            "The Panacloud Assistant is designed to be a comprehensive tool, and it leverages several tools to provide a wide range of functionalities. While the exact number can vary depending on how you define a \"tool\" (e.g., counting individual libraries vs. broader modules), here's a breakdown of the core categories and some examples:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Core Categories & Examples:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** The primary tool is the LLM itself, which is the core intelligence driving the assistant. Examples include:\n",
            "    *   **GPT-4 (or similar powerful models):** Used for complex reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding.\n",
            "*   **Vector Databases:** Used to store and retrieve information quickly based on similarity.  Example:\n",
            "    *   **Pinecone:**  A popular choice for vector storage.\n",
            "*   **Web Search & Information Retrieval:** Tools to gather up-to-date information from the internet. Example:\n",
            "    *   **Google Search API**\n",
            "*   **Code Execution & Analysis:** Allows the assistant to run code snippets and analyze the results. Examples:\n",
            "    *   **Python Interpreter:**\n",
            "    *   **JavaScript Interpreter:**\n",
            "*   **Frameworks and Libraries**\n",
            "    *   **Langchain:** Enables the development of applications powered by language models.\n",
            "    *   **LlamaIndex** Provides a central interface to connect your LLMs with your private data\n",
            "*   **Other specialized tools:** Depending on the specific application, the assistant might integrate with other tools, such as:\n",
            "    *   **Wolfram Alpha:** For mathematical computations and knowledge retrieval.\n",
            "    *   **Specific APIs:** For accessing data from particular services (e.g., weather, news, financial data).\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Considerations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Abstraction:** Many tools are used *behind the scenes* and are abstracted away from the user.  You might not directly interact with Pinecone, for example, but the assistant uses it to retrieve relevant information.\n",
            "*   **Modularity:** The Panacloud Assistant is designed to be modular, meaning that new tools can be added and integrated as needed to expand its capabilities.\n",
            "*   **Dynamic Tool Use:** The assistant doesn't use all tools for every query. It intelligently selects the appropriate tools based on the specific task.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Therefore, it's difficult to give an exact, fixed number. However, it's more accurate to say that Panacloud assistant leverages *multiple* tools including LLMs, Vector Databases, Web search engines, and various APIs to provide a wide range of functionalities.**\n",
            "\n",
            "If you have a more specific question about a particular capability of the Panacloud Assistant, I might be able to give you a more precise answer regarding the tools involved. For example, \"What tool does the assistant use for code generation?\"\n",
